<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    We want you to use Runestone! But before your school district sends me a contract to
    sign, please read

        >This letter</a
    >Please note, cyber insurance has become prohibitively expensive. Basically we can pay our server bill or we can buy insurance.  You would probably rather have us pay our server bill, so anything you can do to convince your district to support Runestone will help me to do both.  Runestone Academy is incorporated as a non-profit, we are awaiting approval of our 501(c)(3) status.

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 60,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the
    August 2021/22 school year.  At $100 a textbook we saved students $6 million last year! Thats a
    lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time.  Please consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and could add support staff.

<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
