Deques
------

We will conclude this introduction to basic data structures by looking
at another variation on the theme of linear collections. However, unlike
stack and queue, the deque (pronounced “deck”) has very few
restrictions. Also, be careful that you do not confuse the spelling of
“deque” with the queue removal operation “dequeue.”
