<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    We want you to use Runestone! But before your school district sends me a contract to
    sign, please read
    <a href="https://blog.runestone.academy/2021/05/28/data_privacy_agreements.html"
        >This letter</a
    >
    I know that many districts will still want a signed agreement. We can process these
    agreements, but beginning January 1, 2023 we will charge your district $100 to do so.
    Runestone Academy is incorporated as a non-profit, we are awaiting approval of our
    501(c)(3) status.

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 60,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the August
    2021/22 school year. At $100 a textbook we saved students $6 million last year! Thats
    a lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up
    and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time. Please
    consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support
    Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and
    could add support staff.
</p>
<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
