<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    We want you to use Runestone! But before your school district sends me a contract to
    sign, please read
    <a href="https://blog.runestone.academy/2021/05/28/data_privacy_agreements.html"
        >This letter</a
    >  Please note, I am working on getting insurance so that I can sign more of these DPAs! But cyber insurance is expensive! Anything you can do to convince your district to support Runestone will help me to do this.
</p>
<h4>Planning for 2022/23?</h4>
<p>
    Several instructors have contacted me about budgeting for Runestone in the next
    school year! Thank you! If you are able to include any amount of support for
    Runestone in your budget for next year that would be awesome! Some departments have
    even added a $10/student lab fee to help support Runestone! I am happy to send you an
    invoice!
</p>
<p>
    If you are curious about Runestone's finances, I am as transparent as possible.
    please see
