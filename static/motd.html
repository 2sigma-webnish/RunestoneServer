<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    We want you to use Runestone! But before your school district sends me a contract to
    sign, please read
    <a href="https://blog.runestone.academy/2021/05/28/data_privacy_agreements.html"
        >This letter</a> I know that many districts will still want a signed agreement.  We can process these agreements, but beginning January 1, 2023 we will charge your district $100 to do so.  Runestone Academy is incorporated as a non-profit, we are awaiting approval of our 501(c)(3) status.
</p>

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 60,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the
    August 2021/22 school year.  At $100 a textbook we saved students $6 million last year! Thats a
    lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time.  Please consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and could add support staff.

</p>
<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
