<h4>Recent Updates (April 28, 2020)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Editorial Page - I am looking for volunteers to be Editors!  This page allows an editor to review questions that have been flagged. It allows you to delete obviously bad questions or edit questions to fix typos or problems with autograding.  If you are interested in becoming an editor please contact me. Here is a short video overview: https://youtu.be/ErWAni-aAI4 </li>
    <li>Chapter Progress -- This report has been greatly updated and enhanced based on teacher feedback.  This is especially useful if you don't use Runestone Assignments.</li>
    <li>Datafiles - You can now add a custom datafile via the assignment interface.  This datafile is available on the assignment page, as well as in the grading interface.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support Runestone</h4>
<p>The last few weeks have seen as many new courses going online as I saw in January!  I'm so happy that
    Runestone can be a resource during this crazy time!  Please consider making a small <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a>
    to help pay for server costs and keeping runestone online.
