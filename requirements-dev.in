# Because Runestone is a combination of javascript and python its not safe to
# install directly from github.
# For development purposes you should clone the runestone components
# git clone https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneComponents.git
# and then pip install -e /path/to/RunestoneComponents
# run npm install in the components folder and then npm run build
